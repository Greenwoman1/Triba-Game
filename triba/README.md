The essence of the game lies in strategically preventing your opponent from making a valid move. By carefully planning your moves, you can effectively block your opponent from forming any triangles. If you successfully achieve this, you will emerge as the victorious player. However, if your opponent manages to create a triangle, you will be deemed the loser.
